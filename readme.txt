##<b>Problem Definition</b>
**The context:** Why is this problem important to solve?<br>

> Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. It remains a major public health issue, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and management of malaria. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic examination of blood smears, are labor-intensive and require significant expertise. By leveraging deep learning, we can automate the detection process, potentially reducing the diagnostic workload on healthcare professionals and improving the accuracy and speed of malaria diagnosis.

**The objectives:** What is the intended goal?<br>

>The primary goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between parasitized and uninfected blood cell images. The intended outcome is a robust and reliable automated diagnostic tool that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing malaria, thereby improving patient outcomes and aiding in the fight against this disease.

**The key questions:** What are the key questions that need to be answered?<br>

>Model Performance: How accurately can the a model distinguish between parasitized and uninfected cells?
>Generalization: How well does the model perform on unseen data (test dataset)?
>Efficiency: How efficient is the model in terms of processing time and resource usage?

**The problem formulation:** What is it that we are trying to solve using data science?

>The aim is to solve the problem of automated malaria diagnosis using data science and deep learning techniques. Specifically, seeking to:

- Data Preparation: Utilize a dataset of labeled images of blood cells, categorized into arasitized and uninfected.
- Model Development: Develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn and distinguish between features of parasitized and uninfected cells.
- Training and Validation: Train the model on a subset of the data and validate its performance on a separate validation set to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
- Testing: Evaluate the model on a test dataset to determine its accuracy and overall robustness.

> In summary, this project addresses a critical need for automated, accurate, and efficient malaria diagnosis. Using deep learning techniques, the goal is to build a model that can reliably distinguish between parasitized and uninfected cells, thereby supporting healthcare professionals in their diagnostic efforts and contributing to the overall goal of reducing the burden of malaria worldwide. The project will involve data preparation, various model development, training, validation, testing and deciding the best solution.
## <b>Data Description </b>

There are a total of 24,958 train and 2,600 test images (colored) that we have taken from microscopic images. These images are of the following categories:<br>


**Parasitized:** The parasitized cells contain the Plasmodium parasite which causes malaria<br>
**Uninfected:** The uninfected cells are free of the Plasmodium parasites<br>
